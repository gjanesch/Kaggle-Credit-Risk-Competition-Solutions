This is the third version of a solution for the Credit Risk competition.  It was intended as a simple neural network-based solution, using very little feature engineering or other processing, as much to practice using Keras as an attempt to create a solution for the competition.  As such, the AUC scores are lower than the logistic regression models.

Similar to v01, this was just a first crack at using this model, so only three submissions were made using this model.

Best public leaderboard AUC: 0.68599
