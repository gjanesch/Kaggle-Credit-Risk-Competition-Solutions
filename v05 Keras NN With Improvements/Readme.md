This is the fifth attempt at a solution, developed as a sequel to the Keras neural network in v03.  It included some feature engineering and use of the supplemental data files.

Not much was done with this solution, due to major fluctuations in AUC scores in working on it combined with v06, an XGBoost-based attempt, being worked on at the same time and being easier an easier model to decipher.

Best public leaderboard AUC: 0.72516
