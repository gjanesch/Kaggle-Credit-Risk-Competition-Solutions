This is the second program used in the competition.  It still relies on logistic regression, but includes a little bit of feature removal.  The main improvement in this version was calculation of the AUC scores and dumping the model's table of features and their significances, to try to sort out which features were actually useful.

The score was not better than the v01 case, which suggested more investigation was needed.

Best public leaderboard AUC: 0.69020
