This was the first attempt at a solution to the challenge.  It consisted of nothing more than a very basic logistic regression purely on data from the application_train data file.  As such, only one submission was made using this model.

As a credit to simpler models, perhaps, it did edge out the random forest benchmark's score of 0.68810.

Public leaderboard AUC: 0.69096
